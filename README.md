# flutter_it

> 📚 **[Complete documentation available at flutter-it.dev](https://flutter-it.dev)**
> Explore comprehensive guides, examples, and best practices for the entire ecosystem!

**A convenience package that imports the entire flutter_it ecosystem in one go.**

> 🏗️ **This is the ideal starting point for implementing [Practical Flutter Architecture (PFA)](https://blog.burkharts.net/practical-flutter-architecture)** — a pragmatic, production-ready architecture that emphasizes simplicity, testability, and maintainability. The flutter_it packages provide all the building blocks you need.

Instead of adding four separate dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  get_it: ^9.0.0
  watch_it: ^2.0.0
  command_it: ^8.0.0
  listen_it: ^5.3.0
```

Just add one:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_it: ^1.0.0
```

And import once:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_it/flutter_it.dart';
```

## What's Included

This package re-exports all four flutter_it packages:

- **[get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)** - Service locator and dependency injection
- **[watch_it](https://pub.dev/packages/watch_it)** - Reactive state management built on get_it
- **[command_it](https://pub.dev/packages/command_it)** - Command pattern with automatic loading/error states
- **[listen_it](https://pub.dev/packages/listen_it)** - ValueListenable operators and reactive collections

## The Construction Set Philosophy

**Important**: flutter_it is a **construction set** of independent packages, not a monolithic framework.

- Each package works **standalone**
- Packages are **independent** building blocks
- Use one or combine several - **you choose**
- Start with what you need, add more later

**You don't need all packages to use this import** - if you only use get_it and watch_it in your code, that's perfectly fine. The other packages are available when you need them.

## Quick Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter_it/flutter_it.dart';

// Use get_it for dependency injection
final getIt = GetIt.instance;

void setup() {
  getIt.registerSingleton<ApiService>(ApiService());
}

// Use watch_it for reactive UI
class MyWidget extends WatchingWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final api = watchIt<ApiService>();
    final data = watchValue((DataModel m) => m.value);

    return Text('$data');
  }
}

// Use command_it for async operations with loading states
final loginCommand = Command.createAsync<bool, LoginCredentials>(
  (credentials) async => apiLogin(credentials),
  initialValue: false,
);

// Use listen_it for ValueListenable operators
final filteredItems = itemsNotifier
    .where((items) => items.length > 0)
    .map((items) => items.take(10));
```

## When Should You Use Individual Packages?

If your project only needs one or two packages from the ecosystem (e.g., just get_it), you might prefer importing them individually to keep your dependencies minimal. This convenience package is ideal when:

- You're using multiple flutter_it packages
- You want to explore the ecosystem without managing multiple imports
- You prefer a single import for cleaner code
